# numerical_analysis
It is about what I have done for the graduat course called 'numerical analysis' in SEU.

There are just five programmings which are the solutions of after class exercises in 5 chapters.

Besides programmings are coded by using python.

If there is any problems in programmings, please contact with me.

I believe there must be more other better solutions.
